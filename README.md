# Front-End Code Test

This is a simple front-end code challenge created to serve two purposes:

1. Show off your skills,
2. Give us a better understanding of your technical ability.

## The Task

The programming challenge exists of 2 parts:
* Part 1: HTML + CSS
* Part 2: Javascript

### PART 1: HTML + CSS

* Consume NASA's mars rover photos api @ https://api.nasa.gov/api.html#MarsPhotos to retrieve a list of mars photos.
* Display the first 10 photos in the HTML + CSS layout created in part 1, sticking to the layout, placing data where it fits.
* You are free to use any **JS/TS framework** you wish, or do it Vanilla JS. 

## Additional Instructions

* Fork this repository.
* After you're done, provide us the link to your repository.
